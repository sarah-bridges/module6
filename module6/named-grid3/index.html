            <h2>Biography</h2><img src="images/sarahpfp.pdf" alt="Sarah Bridges">Sarah Bridges was born in 999 to a witch and a war lord. She trained mercilessly from the time she took her first steps to one day lay claim to the throne of her kingdom. She graduated from university with a B.A. in Cinema and Media Production and is currently continuing her education to take over the library from the Royal Scribe. In her spare time, Sarah enjoys reading, journaling, spending time with her two naughty kitties and rambunctious mutt, courting with her betrothed, experimenting in the kitchen, and watching the latest cinema.
